Hi Team, 
Please find the below source code for the Robot testing as part of the interview for Senior Developer in UK.
There was a time limit which I put for myself(as specified) which I bound to it. So due to the the time limit and these differenct time zones, I started working on this early in the morning.
Mostly i acheieved the functionality and desired conditions are met. 
There are some few changes to the source code (minimal) and logs and also interacting with end user. 
please do the code review as part of interview assessment.

I can do more on the source code and great interaction with user for this console application. But this time due I couldn't due to the early morning timings.
